<h1> A Snake Clone in Unity3d </h1>
Author: Justin D'Errico  <br>
Created: May-June, 2021  <br>
<h2> Goal </h2>
The purpose of this project was to take my first step in learning how to build a function game in Unity3d  
as well as exploring some new aspects of Unity3d and C#
 
<h2> Interesting Aspects </h2>
<h3> QuadFace.cs </h3>
Instead of using quad primitive, drew each quad individually, developing deeper understanding of procedural meshes.
<h3> Fully Scripted </h3>
I wanted to create the entire game through script which I accomplished except for some color and sound assets, which helped me familiarize myself with many Unity3d components.

<h2> Flaws </h2>
<h3> OOP? Who? </h3>
Basically everything is written in one .cs file. Workable for a small game like this but not best practice.
<h3> Poor Game Design </h3>
All of the artistic parts of the game that could distinguish it from other clones are placeholder cubes and the gameSpeed reaches speeds
faster than light after around 20~ apples eaten.
